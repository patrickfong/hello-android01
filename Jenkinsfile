/*
Reguires the Parameter Separator plugin for sane parameter organization

This Jenkinsfile is meant to be shared between Radical and the City of Richmond (COR).

This pipeline is meant to play nicely with Blue Ocean, but will run as a default multi-branch pipeline

Parameters will not be available until the first time this pipeline runs. After that, go into
the Jenkins job and set initial values and rerun the job

The docker image that will be produced will be configured to run in production mode, which
means that environment variables needs to be configured for the image on the docker host that
will be running the container.

//Since we're sharing this file at the moment, we check for the BUILD_OWNER global variable and if it's Radical build on master
